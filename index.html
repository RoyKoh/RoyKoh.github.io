<p>Oh Gosh! Still wondering what to write for a personal blog all about ME! For now, scratching my head squeezing words to pen down though.</p>
￼<p>A big part of this thingy has really to do with my studying in General Assemb.ly Singapore where I was enrolled as a student in Web Development Immersive Course.  It's kind of fascinating journey like what the course administrator, Aziza talked about at the beginning of the course where students are put through a mind-blowing 12 week programme jam packed with state-of-the-art technologies in javascript and mean stack deployment to create a whole new level of web experience.</p>
<p>This 1st cohort of SG-WDI pulled together a whole bunch of web-developer wannabes coming from differing backgrounds but one sure thing to note is the sheer high education level these wonderful chaps possess.  It is amazing to know even computer science graduates are amongst us.  It's been a really nice to have them as classmates.</p>
<p>The greatest takeaway for me as a complete newbie without any programming experience is that, viola! I have learnt some technologies which allow me to deploy an app online which is kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>I would like to dedicate this credit to the course teacher <A HREF="https://ninja.sg">Sebastiaan Deckers</A>, (*hehehehe pardon me about the marquee but honestly this extremely old school stuff was what really fascinated me to javascript even as I was then dumbfounded, I am still including to honour my past*) a great developer for sharing his knowledge.  Cheryl, a teaching assistant for one has been really helpful. I can always remember the weekend she took the time to meet me up in GA SG before the beginning of this course.  Thanks, Cheryl.  Not forgetting Zell, another teaching assistant who joined shortly.  Zell brought in with him to share his vast CSS knowledge and it is really nice to learn from him too.</p>
<p>As the course draws to an end in another 2 weeks time, 5 Feb 2016, about time I continue learning and prepare for the last mini class project.   After that?  Well, get a job!   However, in terms of web development skill, this is my genesis!</p>
<p>In my future posts, I will share the projects I have done but for now am shy to show.  Better make them look pretty first. Haha! :)</p>
<p>Well, for a sweet end to this simple page, I would like to share this moving cock in action. Haha and if you think it is works by me, NOPE! I am a newbie and not skilled in CSS. Just found this funny to give some life.  Great codepen! <A HREF="https://codepen.io/judag/pen/zxKVQR">clo_clo</A> by <A HREF="https://codepen.io/judag/pen/zxKVQR">judag</A>. Thanks Judag! Click on the name to play with the pen. Cheers! I merely made it a little invisible so that it does not block the text.</p>
<p>Upon permission, I will put up the awesome pictures of my classmates and links to their sites of works. SG-WDI rocks!</p>
