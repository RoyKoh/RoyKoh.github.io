<p>Oh Gosh! Still wondering what to write for a personal blog all about ME! For now, scratching my head squeezing words to pen down though.</p>
ï¿¼<p>A big part of this thingy has really to do with my studying in General Assemb.ly Singapore where I was enrolled as a student in Web Development Immersive Course. &nbsp;It's kind of fascinating journey like what the course administrator, Aziza talked about at the beginning of the course where students are put through a mind-blowing 12 week programme jam packed with state-of-the-art technologies in javascript and mean stack deployment to create a whole new level of web experience.</p>
<p>This 1st cohort of SG-WDI pulled together a whole bunch of web-developer wannabes coming from differing backgrounds but one sure thing to note is the sheer high education level these wonderful chaps possess. &nbsp;It is amazing to know even computer science graduates are amongst us. &nbsp;It's been a really nice to have them as classmates.</p>
<p>The greatest takeaway for me as a complete newbie without any programming experience is that, viola! I have learnt some technologies which allow me to deploy an app online which is kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>I would like to dedicate this credit to the course teacher <a href="https://ninja.sg/">Sebastiaan Deckers</a>, (*hehehehe pardon me about the marquee but honestly this extremely old school stuff was what really fascinated me to javascript even as I was then dumbfounded, I am still including to honour my past*) a great developer for sharing his knowledge. &nbsp;Cheryl, a teaching assistant for one has been really helpful. I can always remember the weekend she took the time to meet me up in GA SG before the beginning of this course. &nbsp;Thanks, Cheryl. &nbsp;Not forgetting <a href="http://www.zell-weekeat.com/">Zell</a><img src="./Personal Blog_files/zell.jpg">, another teaching assistant who joined shortly. &nbsp;Zell brought in with him to share his vast CSS knowledge and it is really nice to learn from him too. He has done a great deal online and has been actively involved in facilitating code learning. Marvellous guy! Click to see his blog and his great works.</p>
<p>As the course draws to an end in another 2 weeks time, 5 Feb 2016, about time I continue learning and prepare for the last mini class project. &nbsp; After that? &nbsp;Well, get a job! &nbsp; However, in terms of web development skill, this is my genesis!</p>
<p>In my future posts, I will share the projects I have done but for now am shy to show. &nbsp;Better make them look pretty first. Haha! :)</p>
<p>Well, for a sweet end to this simple page, I would like to share this moving cock in action. Haha and if you think it is works by me, NOPE! I am a newbie and not skilled in CSS. Just found this funny to give some life.  Great codepen! <a href="https://codepen.io/judag/pen/zxKVQR">clo_clo</a> by <a href="https://codepen.io/judag/pen/zxKVQR">judag</a>. Thanks Judag! Click on the name to play with the pen. Cheers! I merely made it a little invisible so that it does not block the text.</p>
<p>Upon permission, I will put up the awesome pictures of my classmates and links to their sites of works. SG-WDI rocks!</p>
<p>There you are! This is <a href="https://github.com/jsstrn">Jesstern Rays</a><img src="./Personal Blog_files/jsstrn.jpg">. He is very much involved in programming and a very knowledgeable person. Thanks for guiding me. It was really cool to see your group chat app with David come to live.</p>
<p>By the way, how people get linked up here has no order of preference but is just that I am slow so I will take it one step at a time</p>
<p>Cool, here is the link to the combined project by <a href="http://codehangout.meteor.com/profile">Albert</a> and <a href="http://codehangout.meteor.com/profile">Calvin</a>, thanks for sharing the site.  </p>
